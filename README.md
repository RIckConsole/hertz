# Hertz

## What does it do?
Hertz checks your essay for words that weaken your writing such as "thing" or "it".
It counts all of the times you use each word and prints the results to the console in a nice format to copy-and-paste into Blackboard.

## Usage
There is a windows program pre built in this repo, and you must run it from the terminal like so:
```bash
./hertz /path/to/your/file
```

## Future plans
I plan to add an argument option that allows you to specify the authors name, and also have it count the number of paragraphs. 
Until then, it gets a lot of the work done really fast.
